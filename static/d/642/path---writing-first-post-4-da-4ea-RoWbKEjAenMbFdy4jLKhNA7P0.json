I\nknow, I know... it's 2019 and most people don't have blogs anymore but publish\non Medium, or write something lengthy and then put a picture of it on Instagram or\nTwitter or <code class=\"language-text\">new_social_platform_name</code> (how bizarre).</p>\n<p>In case you were wondering, this website was built with\n<a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">GatsbyJS</a>. If you know React and you're interested\nin building a static site that's inexpensive to host and easy to maintain, I'd\nrecommend you take a look at the documentation. In a future post, I might give a\nquick rundown of how I put this website together if folks are interested.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4n0xNbfJLR8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","frontmatter":{"title":"First Post"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/writing/first-post/"}}

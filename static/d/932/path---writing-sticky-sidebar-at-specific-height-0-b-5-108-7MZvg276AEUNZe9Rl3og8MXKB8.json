{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Why you may want it</h2>\n<p>Sometimes things on the screen are only supposed to move so much and then stay\nwhere they are. In a task I was working on a few months ago, we decided to\ndo that for a score in the left sidebar of our results page that follows a long\nquiz. We wanted to draw users' focus to the score and keep it at the\ncenter of attention even while users were free to explore the rest of the page.</p>\n<p>When the user scrolls down the score scrolls with the rest of the page\nuntil it reaches the bottom of our fixed header. It then stays there while the\nmain content continues to scroll as the user scrolls. It also detaches\nitself from the fixed header when the user scrolls back up.</p>\n<p>Too many words... observe:</p>\n<iframe style=\"width:100%;\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://codepen.io/simongawlik/full/VqGmKQ\" frameborder=\"1\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2>How you do it</h2>\n<p>As always, you can jump right into the working example\n<a href=\"https://codepen.io/simongawlik/pen/VqGmKQ\">here</a> but we'll walk through it\ntogether below.</p>\n<p>one difficulty is that % calculates differently for position: fixed vs. relative (had to use 150px vs 20%)</p>\n<p>another difficulty is to use a different reference div, otherwise jumpiness when trying to reset the given div</p>\n<p>remember to remove the listener when component is unmounted</p>\n<p>replace the magic numbers in css with css variables if you can</p>\n<p>include iframe of codepen with example (fullscreen)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sticky Sidebar at Specific Height"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/writing/sticky-sidebar-at-specific-height/"}}

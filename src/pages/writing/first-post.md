Welcome to my blog!

```c
#include stdio.h

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello, world!");
}
```


I finally decided to redo my website and as part of the new website, I want
to keep a written record of some of the problems I encounter in my work and personal
projects as well as other musings, things I learned, and ideas (a good old weblog). I
know, I know... it's 2019 and most people don't have blogs anymore but publish
on Medium, or write something lengthy and then upload a picture of it to
Twitter or Instagram or Tumblr or `insert_new_social_platform_name`. I'll
probably cross-post some things but most of my posts will have a home here.

I'm interested in a wide variety of topics and knowledgeable in a narrow slice of that:
programming, software engineering best practices, entrepreneurship, rowing, sports physiology
and training planning, health care more broadly, science and science fiction,
especially things related to space exploration, economics and finance, and I
can't help it... self-helpy and motivational things. In case any of these things
interest you as well, see if you find something you like and send me a
message.

I'll do my best to keep old posts updated as new information becomes available but
in some cases it may not make sense (_I'm looking at you, projects with
npm dependencies_). If you find inaccuracies or errors in my posts, please let
me know and I'll fix them.

In case you were wondering, this website was built with
[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). If you know React and you're interested
in building a static site that's free to build, inexpensive to host, and easy
to maintain, I'd recommend you take a look at the documentation. In a future
post, I might give a quick rundown of how I put this website together.

That's it for now!
